# Habitat_choice_stabilizes_metapopulations

All scripts used for the study published as [title] in [journal]

..-adapt.py contains all classes used in the individual-based model: defines the individual, the metapopulation, the landscape and the sequence of events each timestep. 

..-analysis.py calls the classes in adapt.py to create a metapopulation object and run through the desired number of generations. Afterwards, the desired metrics of each run are saved for further analysis
